# Re-Testing Biomin _Montipora_ Larvae and Saving Half the Volume for DNA/RNA Extraction


**Goal**: Develop a good protocol for extracting high quality DNA and RNA and a good homogenization method for coral larvae/eggs, and save some of the sample to have the possibility to do a second extraction if necessary.  
**Results**: Quantity of DNA and RNA was pretty good for the samples that started with 100 larvae. Quality of DNA and RNA is good. Purity of RNA is not good.  
**Take-aways**: Looks like saving half the initial volume will work for these samples if these yields are enough. We might have to do an extra centrifuge if the wash buffer is carrying over into the elution and causing the poor purity of RNA. Potentially another issue was that I saw there was a noticeable amount of seawater in the tubes before adding the DNA/RNA shield. Unfortunately I didn't take a picture because I added the shield quickly to avoid thawing.

### Sample Info and Protocol Notes

- Samples are flash frozen larvae in 2mL screw cap tubes. **Note, there was some seawater visible in these tubes, probably 100-200ul in there with the larvae**
- Samples are _Montipora_ and from the Biomineralization project

|Sample ID|Date|# Larvae in Original Tube|# Larvae in Extraction|
|---|---|---|---|
|399|20180626|50|25|
|400|20180626|50|25|
|405|20180626|100|50|
|406|20180626|100|50|

- After adding the shield and the samples thawed, I spun them down and removed 500ul (1/2 volume) and put in new 1.5mL tubes. I tried to remove half of the larvae with the volume.
- Followed homogenization method from [adult coral DNA/RNA extraction protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol/) however I proceeded with using the whole volume (~500ul) after that step

### Homogenization

- Took samples one at a time out of -80 and added 1mL of DNA/RNA shield

- 1.5mL tubes were placed on ice for the duration of the extraction and then stored at -80C after the extraction finished  
- Added 1/2 of the glass bead tubes to each screw cap sample tube
- Vortexed for 2 minutes on max speed
- Samples after vortexing, note they look completely homogenized and there seems to be no layer of lipids:

- Spun down tubes a few times to lower bubbles
- Added 50ul Pro K buffer to each tube
- Added 25ul Proteinase K to each tube
- Vortexed and spun down samples again
- Transferred 500ul (most of the volume) to new 1.5mL tubes, avoiding beads. No debris or chunks were visible in the solution

### DNA Extraction
- Warmed 10mM Tris HCl and ultrapure water in thermomixer to 70 degrees C
- Added equal volume of DNA/RNA lysis buffer to each 1.5mL tube (500ul)
- Vortexted and spun down tubes
- Added 700ul of that liquid to a yellow spin column for each sample
- Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
- Pipetted off the flowthrough into new 5mL tubes for each sample for RNA
- Repeated last three steps again until all the liquid had gone through the yellow spin columns for each sample
- Added 400ul prep buffer to each spin column
- Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 30 seconds
- Poured off flowthrough into kit waste beaker
- Added 700ul wash buffer to each spin column
