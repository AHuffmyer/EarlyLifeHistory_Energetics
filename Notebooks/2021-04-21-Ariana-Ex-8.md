# Using [Larvae Extraction Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) on the last 4 of Ariana's _Montipora_ Coral Recruits on Flash Frozen Plugs

**Goal:** Use optimized extraction method on 4 plug samples, no homogenization.   
**Results:** Good DNA and RNA quantity, RNA quality is ok, and DNA quality is smeared but similar to previous plug extractions  
**Take aways**: RNA quality and purity was ok, plug_12 had bad purity but it is for RNASeq not TagSeq and might be ok

### Sample Info

**Note, the whirl packs didn't have numbers so I gave them IDs**

|Sample|Timepoint|
|---|---|
|Plug_9|48hps|
|Plug_10|48hps|
|Plug_11|72hps|
|Plug_12|5dps|


**Notes**

- I did not save any of the plug, I used all of it because there was little material on each one
- I followed the same scrapping protocol as the [first plug post post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Ariana-Ex-6/) except that I did not do the bead homogenization, only vortexing
- The RNA was eluted in 70ul ultrapure water

### Extraction

- [Extraction protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) followed exactly
- Extraction proceeded with ~500ul of each sample
- 500ul of DNA/RNA lysis buffer was used for each sample
- 1mL of 100% ethanol was used for each sample
- All samples were eluted for RNA with 40ul ultrapure water in the first elution and 30ul in the second

### QC

**Qubit**
- Broad Range dsDNA and High Sensitivity RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples were read twice
- Qubit was performed and run by Khadija Haider with support from Maggie

**NanoDrop**

- Followed [NanoDrop RNA Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/Nanodrop-RNA.md)
- NanoDrop was performed and run by Khadija Haider with support from Maggie
