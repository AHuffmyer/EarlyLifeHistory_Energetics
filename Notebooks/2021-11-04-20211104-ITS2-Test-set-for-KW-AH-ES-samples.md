### Goal

To test ITS2 sequencing prep on *Porites astreoides* and *Montipora capitata* samples from the Porites July Bleaching, Symbiont Integration, and Bleaching Pairs projects. The DNA from these samples were extracted with the Zymo Quick-DNA kit and Zymo DNA/RNA mini prep kit plus.

The dilution and plate planning can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFIY0g74x_yjGrz7F8n_IFccVfC5TheEPZtd7_je3uI/edit#gid=1710792962)

### Protocol

I am using a modified version of [this protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2020-01-31-ITS2-Sequencing-Protocol.md) written by E. Strand.

The main modifications from this protocol were to adjust the dilutions for 2 replicates instead of 3.

The negative control was ultrapure water and the positive control was the same positive control from [this ITS2 run](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20210325-Thermal-Transplant-ITS2/) (Becker E9) diluted to 2ng/ul.
