This protocol provides an overview of sampling early life history stages for *Montipora capitata* in July-August 2020.

# Overview  

Notebook entries that describe samples collected will reference to this protocol and will add specific information on sample volume, time of collection, etc.  

# Sampling Procedures  

Sampling is conducted using three methods below. Each method will allow for different sample processing and assays/analyses. Liquid nitrogen snap freezing will allow for metabolomic, biomass, and genomic sampling. Preservation in paraformaldehyde will allow for microscopy approaches. Fixation in RNA/DNA shield will allow for genomic/molecular sampling. At each life stage, samples will be taken with each approach.  

## Snap Freezing in Liquid Nitrogen  

1) Add live samples (larvae, eggs, recruits) to screw-cap cryo-tubes. Using a pipette, remove as much seawater as possible.  
2) Immediately submerge in liquid nitrogen in dewar and allow to freeze for 1-2 minutes.  
3) Move into -80°C freezer for long term storage.  

## Preservation in Paraformaldehyde (PFA)  

1) Prepare 4 percent paraformadehyde solution by diluting concentrated PFA with millepore filtered water. Store this solution in the dark in a flammable cabinet. Transfer fixative to tubes within a properly ventilated hood and with PPE.
2) Add live samples (larvae, eggs, recruits) to screw-cap cryo-tubes. Using a pipette, remove as much seawater as possible.  
3) Add 500-800ul 4 percent PFA, depending on sample volume. Samples should be completely submerged.  
4) Slowly invert tube several times to encourage mixing of fixative in sample.  
5) Store at 4°C overnight.  
6) The next morning (8-12h later), remove 4 percent PFA from tube using a pipette and discard appropriately.
7) Add 70 percent ethanol to sample (500-800uL) for long term storage.  
8) Store at 4°C.  

## Fixation in RNA/DNA Shield  

1) Add live samples (larvae, eggs, recruits) to screw-cap cryo-tubes. Using a pipette, remove as much seawater as possible.  
2) Add RNA/DNA Shield to tube in at least 1 : 3 to 1 : 5 ratio of sample : shield.
3) Store at -20°C until processing. Can store at -80°C for long-term storage.
