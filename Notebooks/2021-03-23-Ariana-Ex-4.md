# Using [Larvae Extraction Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) on 6 of Ariana's _Montipora_ Coral Larvae Stored in DNA/RNA Shield

**Goal:** Use optimized extraction method on 6 samples for Ariana's project and elute the three samples above D29 in only 70ul of ultrapure water instead of 100ul  
**Results:** Good DNA and RNA quantity and quality, RNA purity is ok  
**Take aways**: I made new wash buffer for this extraction and the purity is noticeably better than the last extraction. However the wash buffers should be exactly the same, it could have been the samples. The RNA purity is still not completely good.

|Sample|Timepoint|TP|Volume Shield in Storage| # Larvae|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|D2|1hpf|TP1|1mL|250ul eggs|
|D13|65hpf|TP4|500ulmL|50ul|
|D24|163hpf|TP6|500ul|50ul|
|D29|183hpf|TP9|300ul|15-20 indiviuals|
|D37|231hpf|TP10|300ul|15-20 individuals|
|D40|231hpf|TP10|300ul|15-20 individuals|

Based off of the sample info and how many larvae were present in each tube, save fractions were made for samples D2, D13, and D24, but not D29, D37, and D40.

|Sample|Volume Shield Added at Extraction|Save Fraction?|Saved Volume|
|---|---|---|---|
|D2|0|yes|500ul|
|D13|500ul|yes|500ul|
|D24|500ul|yes|500ul|
|D29|200ul|no|-|
|D37|200ul|no|-|
|D40|200ul|no|-|

I eluted the RNA of D29, D37 and D40 in 70ul of ultrapure water instead of 100ul

### Extraction

- [Extraction protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) followed exactly
- Extraction proceeded with 500ul of each sample
- 500ul of DNA/RNA lysis buffer was used for each sample
- 1mL of 100% ethanol was used for each sample
- Samples D29, D37 and D40 were eluted with 40ul ultrapure water in the first elution and 30ul in the second

### QC

**Qubit**
- Broad Range dsDNA and Borad Range RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples were read twice
