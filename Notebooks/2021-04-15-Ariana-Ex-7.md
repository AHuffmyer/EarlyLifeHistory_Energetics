# Using [Larvae Extraction Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) on 5 of Ariana's _Montipora_ Coral Recruits on Flash Frozen Plugs

**Goal:** Use optimized extraction method on 6 plug samples and share 1 72hr plug with Kevin (doing metabolomics extractions), I did not do any bead homogenization this time    
**Results:** Good DNA and RNA quantity, RNA quality is ok, and DNA quality is less smeared than last time  
**Take aways**: RNA quality and purity was ok, DNA is still smeared but not as bad as with the bead beating. The scraping from the plugs must be very harsh for it or something.  

### Sample Info

**Note, the whirl packs didn't have numbers so I gave them IDs, some plugs had a number on them**

|Sample|Timepoint|Number|
|---|---|---|
|Plug_4|48hps|98|
|Plug_5|48hps|57|
|Plug_6|72hps|--|
|Plug_7|48hps|--|
|Plug_8|5dps|461|

**Notes**

- I did not save any of the plug, I used all of it because there was little material on each one
- I followed the same scrapping protocol as the [previous post](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Ariana-Ex-6/) except that I did not do the bead homogenization, only vortexing
- The RNA was eluted in 70ul ultrapure water

### Extraction

- [Extraction protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) followed exactly
- Extraction proceeded with ~500ul of each sample
- 500ul of DNA/RNA lysis buffer was used for each sample
- 1mL of 100% ethanol was used for each sample
- All samples were eluted for RNA with 40ul ultrapure water in the first elution and 30ul in the second

### QC

**Qubit**
- Broad Range dsDNA and High Sensitivity RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples were read twice

BR DNA:

|Sample|Standard 1|Standard 2|DNA 1 ng/ul|DNA 2 ng/ul| Average ng/ul|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Plug_4|177|19116|1.2|50.8|51|
|Plug_5|-|-|19.9|19.6|19.75|
|Plug_6|-|-|44.2|43.4|42.8|
|Plug_7|-|-|30.2|29.6|29.9|
|Plug_8|-|-|37.8|37.4|37.6|

HS RNA:

|Sample|Standard 1|Standard 2|RNA 1 ng/ul|RNA 2 ng/ul| Average ng/ul|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Plug_4|45|765|80.6|79.6|80.1|
|Plug_5|-|-|77.4|77.6|77.5|
|Plug_6|-|-|27.2|27.2|27.2|
|Plug_7|-|-|53.2|52.8|53|
|Plug_8|-|-|56.4|56.2|56.3|

**NanoDrop**

- Followed [NanoDrop RNA Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/Nanodrop-RNA.md)

|Sample|260/230|260/280|

|Plug_4|1.39|1.94|
|Plug_5|1.01|2.03|
|Plug_6|1.01|1.79|
|Plug_7|1.14|1.88|
|Plug_8|1.28|1.96|


**Gel**
- 1% gel run for 1 hour at 100V
- [Gel Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/Agrose-Gel-Protocol.md)
