# Using [Larvae Extraction Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) on 4 of Ariana's _Montipora_ Coral Larvae Stored in DNA/RNA Shield

**Goal:** Use optimized extraction method on a few of Ariana's samples just to be super sure it works  
**Results:** Good DNA and RNA quantity and quality, variable RNA purity  
**Take aways**: This method works, how it was split up for the samples that I saved half worked well. Looks like the timepoint 2 samples might be close to eggs and don't have enough DNA to extract well

### Sample Info:

|Sample|Timepoint|TP|Volume Shield in Storage| # Larvae|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|D8|5hpf|TP2|1mL| 100ul|
|D14|65hpf|TP4|500ul| 50ul|
|D17|93hpf|TP5|500ul| 50ul|
|D36|231hpf|TP8|300ul| 20-30 individuals|

Based off of the sample info and how many larvae were present in each tube, save fractions were made for samples D8, D14, and D17, but not for D36

|Sample|Volume Shield Added at Extraction|Save Fraction?|Saved Volume|
|---|---|---|---|
|D8|0ul|yes|500ul|
|D14|500ul|yes|500ul|
|D17|500ul|yes|500ul|
|D36|200ul|no|-|

### Extraction

- [Extraction protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Larvae-Ex-Protocol/) followed exactly
- Samples thawed before extraction:

D36

- Samples after additional Shield was added to some samples and some were made into save fractions:

- Extraction proceeded with 500ul of each sample
- 500ul of DNA/RNA lysis buffer was used for each sample
- 1mL of 100% ethanol was used for each sample

### QC

**Qubit**
- Broad Range dsDNA and High Sensitivity RNA Qubit [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples were read twice
- DNA:

|Sample|Standard 1|Standard 2|DNA 1 ng/ul|DNA 2 ng/ul| Average ng/ul|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|D8|181|19382|too low|-|-|
|D14|-|-|14.3|14.1|14.2|
|D17|-|-|32|31.6|31.8|
|D36|-|-|17.5|17.3|17.4|

- RNA:

|Sample|Standard 1|Standard 2|RNA 1 ng/ul|RNA 2 ng/ul| Average ng/ul|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|D8|46|815|118|118|118|
|D14|-|-|89|88.6|88.8|
|D17|-|-|50|49.6|49.8|
|D36|-|-|12|11.8|11.9|

**NanoDrop**

- Followed [NanoDrop RNA Protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/Nanodrop-RNA.md)

|Sample|260/230|260/280|
|---|---|---|
|D8|1.37|2.10|
|D14|1.89|2.08|
|D17|1.70|2.01|
|D36|0.91|1.68|
